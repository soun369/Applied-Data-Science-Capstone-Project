# Applied-Data-Science-Capstone-Project
This project is the final milestone in the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate. It combines skills in data collection, analysis, visualization, and machine learning to solve a real-world business challenge.

Using data from SpaceX API and Wikipedia, we aim to predict the likelihood of a Falcon 9 rocket’s first stage landing successfully — a key factor in reducing launch costs.

🔍 Objectives:

Analyze how features like payload mass, launch site, orbit type, and flight history impact landing success.

Study trends in successful landings over time.

Identify the best-performing binary classification model for this use case.

🛠️ Tools & Techniques:

Data Wrangling & One-Hot Encoding

EDA with SQL and Seaborn/Matplotlib

Interactive Dashboards using Plotly Dash and Folium

Predictive Modeling with Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, and SVM

📊 Final output: An interactive dashboard and a trained model that helps estimate if a SpaceX first stage is likely to land — aiding cost prediction for commercial launches.
