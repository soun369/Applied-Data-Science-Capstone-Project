# Applied-Data-Science-Capstone-Project
This Capstone is the final course in the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate specialization, summarizing all previously learned materials through a hands-on project. The project focuses on predicting the success of SpaceX Falcon 9 first stage landings, which is crucial for understanding cost savings due to rocket reusability. The analysis explores how variables like payload mass, launch site, number of flights, and orbit affect landing success, and whether the success rate has improved over time. The data was collected via the SpaceX REST API and Wikipedia web scraping, followed by cleaning, encoding, and exploratory analysis using SQL and visual tools like Folium and Plotly Dash. Finally, multiple classification models were built, tuned, and evaluated to identify the most effective algorithm for binary classification in this context.
